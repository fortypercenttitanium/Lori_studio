            <p>Most people are aware that music lessons help foster a lifelong love and appreciation of music, as well as improve the skills associated with being a musician. But did you know that are are scientifically proven intellectual benefits as well? <a href="https://www.theedadvocate.org/9-benefits-music-lessons/" target='_blank'>This article from TheEdAdvocate</a> explains 9 ways in which lessons directly affect brain development in children, including boosting academic achievement and self-esteem!</p>

            <p>No matter your age or experience level, music lessons can benefit you unlike anything else. Whether you are beginning your journey as a musician, want to try something new, or need someone to challenge you to take that next step in your performing career, my lessons can provide the support and encouragement you need.</p>

            <p>Some teachers try to fit their students into a mold that may not work, but my methods use the music my students enjoy to highlight their strengths and emphasize good technique. I believe this style caters to each studentâ€™s personality and truly brings out their best as an artist.</p>
